This is published in PNAS titled [Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/01/07/1418680112). 
#### Main Idea
The authors use **LASSO linear regression** for judgments for each participant based on **Facebook Likes**. 
#### Ground Truth
The Ground Truth is obtained from the participants' Facebook friends by describing him/her using a *10-item* version of **IPIP** personality measure. And there're **70,520** participants. 
#### Result
Computer-based predictions outperform human-based ones with score $r=0.56$ to $r=0.49$.
